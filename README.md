We investigate the evidence construction, i.e., *the direct and indirect evidence* with the statistical parameters in message exchange. Specifically, we construct *behavior classifiers* to distinguish the blackhole behaviors from rational ones and design the collusion filtering strategy to improve the detection accuracy by separating corrupted nodes from rational ones, respectively, laying a behavior identification foundation.

Based on the classifying results, the 'detecting' nodes will not cooperate with the 'detected' nodes (i.e., the 'Positive' node in the Blackhole detection).
